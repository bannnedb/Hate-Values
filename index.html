        <p>AmericanValues was never meant to be anything more than a project for me to develop other people's code; it was not meant to be an accurate political test. I eventually stopped working on it and forgot it even existed â€” until Reddit found it, and dozens of users began taking the test. Their results where hilariously inaccurate, prompting a few kind souls to submit issues to suggest improvements, and I definitely appreciate it! Thank yall!</p>

        <p>So to give back to those of yall who took the time out of your day to help me make my forgotten project a little less terrrible: I'm releasing Beta 3.0. This will be the last version of AmericanValues I will ever release. Feel free to fork this project and continue my work, but I'll no longer be contributing. I met my goal of adapting 8values, and I'm moving on to other projects.</p>

        <p>I've had arguments with real Fascists, who identify as such and politically align with Hitler, and we're nothing alike; they hate me. I'm a Centrist, not a Nazi. Perhaps from the perspective of a Communist I'd be far-right, but not from the perspective of most Americans. Don't feel bad for mislabelling me, however; the Trump supporters thought I was a Communist for a good while.</p>

<h2>What is Hate Values?</h2>
    <p>Hate Values is a quiz that attempts to assign percentages for thirty-two different values which range from sexuality to animal rights, aiming to cover various different topics in one test. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2><a id="anchor">What are the thirty-two values?</a></h2>
    <p>There are sixteen independent axes - Race, Jewish, Sex, Diversity, Sexuality, Transgender, Pedophilia, Species, Legality, Disability, Tolerance and Furry - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 17pt;">What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
